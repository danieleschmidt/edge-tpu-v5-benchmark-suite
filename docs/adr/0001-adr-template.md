# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

**Status**: Template  
**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

## Context

This template provides the standard format for Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in the Edge TPU v5 Benchmark Suite project. ADRs help us document important architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## Decision

We will use this template for all architectural decisions going forward. Each ADR will be numbered sequentially and stored in the `docs/adr/` directory.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear documentation of architectural decisions and rationale
- Historical context for future developers
- Improved decision-making process through structured analysis

### Negative  
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Need to maintain ADR discipline across team
