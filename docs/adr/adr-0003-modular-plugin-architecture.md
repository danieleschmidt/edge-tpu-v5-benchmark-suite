# ADR-0003: Modular Plugin Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Edge TPU v5 Benchmark Suite needs to support various model types, benchmark scenarios, and analysis methods while remaining maintainable and extensible. Key considerations include:

- Need to support different model categories (CV, NLP, audio, etc.)
- Extensibility for community contributions
- Separation of concerns between core functionality and specific implementations
- Ability to add new metrics and analysis methods
- Support for different hardware configurations and environments

## Decision

We will implement a modular plugin architecture that separates core benchmarking functionality from specific implementations of models, metrics, and analysis methods.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new models, metrics, and benchmark types
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between core logic and specific implementations
- **Community Contributions**: Lower barrier for external contributors to add new benchmarks
- **Testing**: Easier unit testing of individual components
- **Flexibility**: Can support different benchmark strategies without core changes

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Additional abstraction layers increase initial complexity
- **Performance Overhead**: Plugin loading and dispatch may introduce latency
- **Coordination**: Need for well-defined interfaces and contracts between plugins
- **Documentation**: Requires comprehensive plugin development documentation

### Architecture Components

```python
# Core Interfaces
class BenchmarkPlugin(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_supported_models(self) -> List[str]:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def run_benchmark(self, model: str, config: BenchmarkConfig) -> BenchmarkResults:
        pass

class MetricPlugin(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_metrics(self, raw_results: RawResults) -> Dict[str, float]:
        pass

class AnalysisPlugin(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def analyze_results(self, results: BenchmarkResults) -> AnalysisReport:
        pass
```

### Plugin Categories
1. **Model Plugins**: Specific model implementations (vision, nlp, audio)
2. **Metric Plugins**: Performance calculation methods
3. **Analysis Plugins**: Result analysis and visualization
4. **Export Plugins**: Different output formats and destinations

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Architecture
- **Pros**: Simpler initial implementation, no plugin overhead
- **Cons**: Difficult to extend, tight coupling, harder to test
- **Decision**: Rejected due to extensibility requirements

### Microservices Architecture
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility, language independence
- **Cons**: Deployment complexity, network overhead, overkill for desktop tool
- **Decision**: Rejected due to complexity for end-user tool

### Simple Inheritance Hierarchy
- **Pros**: Object-oriented, familiar pattern
- **Cons**: Limited flexibility, multiple inheritance issues, tight coupling
- **Decision**: Rejected in favor of composition-based plugin system

## Implementation Strategy

### Plugin Discovery
- Entry points in setup.py for automatic plugin discovery
- Manual plugin registration for development/testing
- Plugin validation and compatibility checking

### Configuration Management
- Plugin-specific configuration sections
- Runtime plugin selection and configuration
- Default plugin selection for common use cases

### Error Handling
- Graceful plugin failure handling
- Fallback mechanisms for missing or failed plugins
- Comprehensive error reporting and logging
