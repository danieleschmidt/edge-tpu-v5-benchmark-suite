# Edge TPU v5 Benchmark Suite - Project Charter

## Executive Summary

The Edge TPU v5 Benchmark Suite is the first comprehensive open-source benchmarking framework for Google's TPU v5 edge computing cards, addressing a critical gap in the edge AI ecosystem where no public workloads showcase v5's unique capabilities and compiler optimizations.

## Problem Statement
